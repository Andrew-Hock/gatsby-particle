# Gatsby Particle

## What is this?

> Gatsby [themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/) encapsulate all of the
> configuration and implementation details of Gatsby websites. This is an experiment
> aimed at developing a dependancy to be called `gatsby-theme-particle`
> package. The primary goal of `gatsby-theme-particle` is to get content authors
> speaking the AppDynamics Design Language with Particle as seemlessly and soon as possible.
> It includes some sample components/content demos in the `src/pages` directory.

## How do I use it?

`gatsby-theme-particle` at it’s core relies on [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) for page
creation. Check out the `src/pages` directory for some examples for using mdx.

A key feature of Gatsby themes is component shadowing. By simply placing a
component into the `src/gatsby-theme-particle/components` location, you can
override components used by the theme. You can read more about component
shadowing

You’re also free to make your own components and use them in your MDX pages.
